# Stock-Risk-Management-Calculator
A stock risk management calculator is a tool used to assess and manage the risks associated with investing in stocks. 

It helps investors determine their profit targets,  and set appropriate stop-loss levels based on their risk preferences.

Stop-Loss Calculation: A stop-loss order is a predetermined price level at which an investor will sell a stock to limit potential losses. The calculator helps determine the appropriate stop-loss level based on factors like the stock's volatility and your risk tolerance.
